# parallel-optimization via ADMM

## Abstract
This work solve large-scale optimization problem via ADMM. This is a QP problem which generated from my cooperative control of multiple vehicles. This work contains synchronous and asynchronous algorithms.

For more information of ADMM, you can read this paper [Distributed optimization and statistical learning via the alternating direction method of multipliers](https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/MAL-016, "admm")

## Performance
A good performance is obtained
